### What is Ethtags?

Ethtags is a project built on an ethereum smart contract that was developed by @jtomes123.The smart contract is almost finalized, the final version is almost ready. Verification of names is also implemented.

There will be changes soon which will allow you to attach a name and some short message to your ethereum address.
Verification of names is also implemented.

### Features of Ethtags?


* You can attach your name to your ethereum address.

* You can also add a short message, like some info about you.

* The information above are stored in the ethereum network and I call them dogtag.

* Only you can edit your dogtag.

* Anyone can see your dogtag through the frontend.

* Information in your dogtag can be verified, it would be great to collaborate with exchanges in future, since they have to verify the identity of their users anyway.

* There is an option to donate to the contract when you change your dogtag, this should help to cover the maintanance costs.

* You can generate an iframe that can be used as a signature on forums, etc...

### What are the benefits of using ethtags?

* Noone else can tamper with your dogtag.

* The contract stores information in separate contract, which means it is easily updateable.

* You can check that it is really your friend you are sending the ethereum to, if they have their dogtag set up and are verified

* Everything is decentralized and safely stored in the blockchain
